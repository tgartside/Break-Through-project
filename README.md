Break Through follows a female game developer as she goes about her day.

Throughout the day, she encounters various difficulties she must confront, some of which specifically due to her gender and related workplace biases.



The game itself is a 2D platformer in which the player can run, jump, and use a grappling hook to navigate each level, while interacting with each difficulty to progress.
